These are ebuilds used on a cluster. They are mainly updated
versions from the Gentoo Science Overlay
(http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/sci.git;a=summary)
but they could be written from scratch.

To add the repo to layman's database, to the following:

1. Add https://raw.github.com/nbigaouette/ebuilds/master/overlay.xml
to the "overlays" section of /etc/layman/layman.cfg.

2. Fetch the remote list of database using "layman -f"

3. Add the repo to layman using "layman -a nbigaouette"
